    	<h1>Asus K55N: Cheap Gaming Laptop</h1>
    	<p>The goal for this project is to upgrade my Asus K55N laptop for gaming. The K55N is based on the AMD APU system which uses a combined CPU and graphics card. These systems can be found for $200 to $300 used on ebay.<span id="more-25"></span></p>
<p>The system will be benchmarked using</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://unigine.com/products/valley/">Valley</a> &#8211; A modern 3d benchmark (Basic Preset, fullscreen, 1366&#215;768)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.playonline.com/ff11eu/download/media/benchmark01.html?pageID=media">Final Fantasty 11 benchmark</a> &#8211; This is an Playstation 2 era MMO that was ported to the PC. I&#8217;m including this score because I play this game a lot, but it will show how well the system handles older CPU tied games. (High Setting)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/benchmark/download/index.html">Final Fantasy 14 benchmark</a> &#8211; I would like to start playing this game and it would be great if it  the K55N can handle it. (Laptop (High), fullscreen, 1366&#215;768)</li>
</ol>
<div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4"><h3>Baseline System</h3>
        	<ul>
				<li>APU: AMD A8-4500M</li>
				<li>RAM: 8gb generic DDR3 675mhz 9-9-10-24</li>
			</ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><h3>Memory Upgrade</h3>
        	<p>The graphics card in the APU does not have dedicated RAM, it shares system memory. So it is important to use the fastest system ram you can support. I added a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DSGLMPK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DSGLMPK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=alexajamesmar-20&amp;linkId=G4PKTT2542WT6KZ2">Crucial Ballistix Sport SODIMM 8GB Kit</a> which I estimate will be about 20% faster. This ram is spec at 800mhz 9-9-9-24, but my system decided to run it at 809mhz 9-9-10-24.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><h3>APU Upgrade</h3>
        	<p>I replaced the <a href="http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-A-Series-A8-4500M-Notebook-Processor.74884.0.html">A8-4500M</a> with an <a href="http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-A-Series-A10-4600M-Notebook-Processor.74065.0.html">A10-4600M</a>. This A10 is 400mhz faster and has 128 more shader cores than the A8. I tried to use an A10-5750M, this APU is pin compatible with the socket but the display does not work.</p>
			<p>There is a great guide to this procedure on <a href="http://www.insidemylaptop.com/how-to-disassemble-asus-k55n-ds81/">Inside my laptop</a>. It will take about an hour.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4"><h3>Analysis</h3>
        	The upgrade gave me a 32% improvment in Valley Benchmark, 18% in FF11, and 21% in FF14. The total cost for the upgrades was around $95.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><h3>Conclusion</h3>
        	If you already own one of these older laptops any would like to get some more usage out of it before replacing it this may be a worthwhile upgrade. However, if you are looking for low-end gaming laptop you would be better off saving money for a little while longer and looking for a laptop with a discrete video card in the $500 to $700 range.
